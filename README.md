# BIO Data Analysis Projects

A small collection of biology data-analysis reports exploring evolution, ecological diversity, and pigment absorption.  
Each project includes real data, visualizations, and short written summaries.

## Included Reports
- **Plankton Diversity Analysis**  
  Uses Simpson’s Diversity Index to compare species diversity across coastal sites and tide conditions.

- **Selection vs. Drift Snail Simulation**  
  Analyzes color-frequency changes in snail populations under natural selection and genetic drift.

- **Algal Pigment Absorption Study**  
  Visualizes absorption spectra from spinach, green algae, brown algae, and red algae using spectrophotometer data.

## Tools Used
- R (ggplot2, dplyr, gsheet)
- Google Sheets data import
- Boxplots, line graphs, summary tables, t-tests
